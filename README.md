<h1>Install and Set Up Fail2Ban</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project we will install and set up Fail2Ban to help in preventing and mitigating SSH attacks since we need to leave this port open in order to access the server remotely for updates and maintenance. We will also show how to enable nginx protection since this server also uses an nginx webserver. The main focus in this project however is to to protect against SSH attacks.
<br />


<h2>Environments Used: </h2>

- <b>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, running on a DigitalOcean Droplet connected over SSH from a local Manjaro system</b>

<h2>Installation and Set-Up walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Fail2ban is already in the Unbuntu repositories so we can install normally using apt: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once the install is completed we will need to navigate to the directory with the config file:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We will check the first part of the config file to see that since this file could update and be overwritten when Fail2ban updates, we will need to create a .local config: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next, we will copy the contents of jail.conf into a jail.local file so we can create and edit our own config, then open this in nano for editing:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We will leave some settings at their defaults but will change the bantime to be 30 minutes:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next, we will check the default action for fail2ban when it detects an issue, default is to update iptables to block the nefarious IP from the server. Other actions, like email notifications are listed prior to this line and can be added by changing the variable in this line:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Then we will enable sshd monitoring by adding a line to the config file:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We will also enable nginx monitoring using the same method as before for auth and botsearch, we will not be enabling limit-req:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
We will then enable, start and check the status of fail2ban to make sure it is running. We have successfully installed, configured and started the fail2ban service!  <br/>
